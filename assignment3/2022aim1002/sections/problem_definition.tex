\textit{Input: }consists of the following:\newline
(1) A road network, $G(V, E)$, where each node $v \in V$ is associated with certain spatial coordinates and each edge $e \in E$ associated with a cost and a score value.\newline
(2) A source $s \in V$ and a destination $d \in V$.\newline
(3) A positive value \textit{overhead}. We define the term \textit{budget} as the sum of overhead and the cost of the shortest path between $s$ and $d$.\newline
\textit{Output: }A directed path $P\ast$ between $s$ and $d$.\newline
\textit{Objective function: }Maximize $\Gamma(P\ast)$\newline
\textit{Constraint: }$\Phi(P\ast) \leq budget$
